Note Taker app
With this application I used express.js to create a note taker app. The goal here was to create an application where a user can write and save notes and these notes will be saved into the database. This app is very intuitive with the right side consisting of an area for creating new notes and giving them a header and body and being able to save them with a click of a button which then sends it over to the left side of the page which you can click on for easy viewing of previous notes. I also implemented a delete feature so that a user can delete any notess they no longer have any use for. I set up the server.js so that it could connect the homeroutes to the front end and I also created the api and html routes and a store.js for saving the created notes into the database here.
